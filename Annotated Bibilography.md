## Annotated Bibliography

1) Appelhof, M.; Olszewski, J.; Stewart, A. _Worms Eat My Garbage, 35th Anniversary Edition: How to Set Up and Maintain a Worm Composting System: Compost Food Waste, Produce Fertilizer for Houseplants and Garden, and Educate Your Kids and Family_, Annotated edition.; Storey Publishing, LLC: North Adams, MA, 2017.

This seems to be the classic resource for vermicomposting. I read the updated version that was nicely laid out with a lot of good info and graphics. It was a very accessible resource for someone checking things out for the first time. 

2) The Urban Worm Company (https://urbanwormcompany.com/)

This is a company that sells their own worm bin \[not the one that I have used\] and accessories but they have a great number of resources geared at beginners. They also have a good YouTube channel with lots of good resources.
