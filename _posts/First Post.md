This site will be used to document my journey through vermicomposting and also to fight writer's block when I don't want to write professionally. 


## The Why

	My interest in composting started after reading some books during the winter of 2022-23. As of the time of writing, it has been the 8th snowiest winter in the Twin Cities. We have been cooped up for a long time (111 straight days with at least an inch of snow on the ground!!!) and I was spending too much time on my phone and with my ear buds listening to podcasts/e-books.
