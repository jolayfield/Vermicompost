This site will be used to document my journey through vermicomposting and also to fight writer's block when I don't want to write professionally. 

## The What

I am going to use this site to document my progress in starting a vermi compost bin ("worm farm") to use as a way to fertilize our expanding garden and to help reduce the amount of food waste that we send to a landfill.

I settled on setting up a bird feeder with my 4 year old and trying to engage my 7 year old with starting a "worm farm". The boys are only mildly excited at this point but I hope as the number of worms grow they will get more into the process. 

## Initial Setup 

I picked up my 7 year old from school early one Friday, and we went to Target to get the basic supplies that we needed to get the initial bin started.

Both boys enjoyed drilling holes in the plastic totes and we got everything stacked and put together that weekend.
