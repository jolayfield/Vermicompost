This site will be used to document my journey through vermicomposting and also to fight writer's block when I don't want to write professionally. 

## The What

I am going to use this site to document my progress in starting a vermi compost bin ("worm farm") to use as a way to fertilize our expanding garden and to help reduce the amount of food waste that we send to a landfill. Since St. Paul doesn't collect organic waste, I decided to find a solution that didn't involve driving to a central facility. 


## The Why

My interest in composting started after reading some books during the winter of 2022-23. As of the time of writing, it has been the 8th snowiest winter in the Twin Cities. We have been cooped up for a long time (111 straight days with at least an inch of snow on the ground!!!) and I was spending too much time on my phone and with my ear buds listening to podcasts/e-books. 

I thought that it would be helpful for me to pursue a hobby that would be decidedly "physical" and would also be a way for me to engage my boys with a project that would be better than talking about PJ Masks or the latest Retrobowl developments. I settled on setting up a bird feeder with my 4 year old and trying to engage my 7 year old with starting a "worm farm". The boys are only mildly excited at this point, but I hope as the number of worms grow they will get more into the process.
